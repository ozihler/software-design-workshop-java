# Extract, wrap, move

Basic idea: bring data and functionality on that data closer together
1. Extract some logic as method or function
2. Wrap data passed to that method in new class or type
3. Move extracted method/function either into newly created class (OOP) or a file close to that type (FP)

1 and 2 may be exchanged. If there exists already a suitable class or type, 2 may be omitted.
