## Dead Code

### Explanation
Code segments that aren't invoked or run, or are only triggered during testing. These can be in the form of methods, method parameters, local variables, fields, specific code branches, or even entire classes.

### Reason
- Adds an additional layer of complexity that necessitates understanding and maintenance.
- Leads to escalated maintenance expenses.
- The presence of dead code can sometimes point to other non-functioning code segments.

### Remedial Action
- Employ tools to identify dead code (be cautious of reflection calls made by frameworks or custom code!).
- Purge the identified dead code.

### Root Cause
- Instances where code references were deleted or code was crafted but remained unused.
- Developers might comment out segments of code thinking they might revert back to it, resulting in reluctance from others to delete such portions.

### Acceptable Scenarios?
The exact circumstances under which dead code might be acceptable remain ambiguous.
