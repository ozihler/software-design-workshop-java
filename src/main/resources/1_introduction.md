# Introduction

> **Good vs. Bad Code**
> 
> Grab some sticky notes and write down **what makes code good or bad for you personally** and place it on the whiteboard.

## Bad Code
* Bad code requires mental mapping between the outside world and the internals of the code because the internal structure of the software does not match the outside world.
* With every iteration, this mental work increases, which decreases team productivity continuously.

## Good Code
* Good code on the other hand minimises the mapping between the outside world and the internals of the code.
* The outside world is represented in code using appropriate, human-readable abstractions.
* Productivity stays high from start of software creation to its phase-out.
* In the best case, everybody involved in the creation of the software (also business, customer, users, POs, ScMs, etc.)
share the same mental model (so called Ubiquitous Language in Domain-Driven Design)
