## Inconsistent Approach

### Description
The same challenge is addressed using varying methods throughout the codebase.

### Illustration
- There are instances where string concatenation is used, at times `StringBuilder.append()`, or `String.format()`, and even `MessageFormat` for constructing log messages.
- Diverse logging frameworks and facades can be seen.
- Some use framework-implemented equals/hashCode, while others have custom implementations.
- Variations like `foreach`, `for(i)`, and `stream().forEach()` are observed in loops.
- Inconsistencies in code formatting are also evident.

### Underlying Issue
- This goes against the D.R.Y. (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- It amplifies the code's complexity.
- It's prone to errors since not all developers might be familiar with the intricacies of each approach.

### Remedial Action
Hold discussions within the team to reach a consensus on a single method and then implement it uniformly across the board.

### Root Cause
There's a lack of communication among developers. This could hint at deeper interpersonal issues within the team.
